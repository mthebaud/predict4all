/**
 * This correction is the most convenient way to create correction rules as it allow direct modification and has helping methods.<br>
 * The {@link WordCorrectionGenerator} will then generate {@link CachedPrecomputedCorrectionRule} to use this rule.<br>
 * Note that a single builder instance can result in multiple correction rule : correction rule should never be directly configured by user as this correction rule is more understandable.<br>
 * Correction rule work as the following : you define errors which are the part replaced, and replacements which are the part correcting errors.
 * The corrector will then try to replace every errors in the input text with every replacements to generate valid words : this method allow correction algorithm to work
 * very early during prediction process : it could for example correct the first two letters of a six letter word while a classic string distance algorithm would be lost.<br>
 * However, this algorithm is expensive as it generate many possible word. That's why {@link org.predict4all.nlp.words.correction.WordCorrectionGenerator} try to stop processing as early as possible.<br>
 * Moreover, parameters like {@link #getCost()} or {@link #getMaxIndexFromEnd()} etc allow the rule to be restrictive to a certain area of the input.<br>
