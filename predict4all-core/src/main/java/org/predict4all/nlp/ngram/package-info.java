/**
 * Package containing everything about the NGram model used in Predict4All.<br>
 * Contains the ngram training algorithm in {@link org.predict4all.nlp.ngram.NGramDictionaryGenerator}<br>
 * Also contains {@link org.predict4all.nlp.ngram.trie.AbstractNGramTrieNode} : a trie structure that can be implemented in both ways : dynamic or static.<br>
 * This trie structure allow having a huge number of ngram available for probability computation without loading them into memory.
