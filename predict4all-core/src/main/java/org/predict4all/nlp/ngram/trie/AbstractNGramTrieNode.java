/**
 * Represent a node in a trie structure to represent ngrams. Trie structure is used to save memory because information about ngram are very redundant.<br>
 * <br>
 * For example, the trie for sentences <i>"this is sentence. this is what"</i> will contains following nodes (showing 3 gram only):
 * <p>
 * - this<br>
 * --- is<br>
 * ----- sentence<br>
 * ----- what<br>
 * <p>
 * Trie node can be static or dynamic, where both has different application :<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Static</strong> : static trie node are node loaded on demand while browsing the trie structure. Their frequencies and backoff weight are pre-computed and used "as it" by the dictionary. Static node doesn't support
 * insertion/remove. They are useful to browse huge ngram trie with a limited memory use.</li>
 * <li><strong>Dynamic</strong> : dynamic trie node are fully loaded (which mean than the whole trie is loaded into memory) and they support insertion/removal. Their frequencies and bow are computed but can be dynamically computed because the count
 * values are loaded. They are useful to train a ngram model (counting) or when the ngram trie is small (e.g. user ngram model).</li>
 * </ul>
