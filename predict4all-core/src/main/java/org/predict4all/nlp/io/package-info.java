/**
 * Contains custom {@link java.io.InputStream} and {@link java.io.OutputStream} to save/load Predict4All specific items ({@link org.predict4all.nlp.parser.token.Token} and {@link org.predict4all.nlp.words.model.Word}).<br>
 * Note that NGram are saved without these stream as they are designed to be loaded on demand with a {@link java.nio.channels.FileChannel}.<br>
 * Both token and word streams extends {@link java.io.DataOutputStream} or {@link java.io.DataInputStream} : this was done for optimization, this method is much more optimized that using any other serialization methods.
